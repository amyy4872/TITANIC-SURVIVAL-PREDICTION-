# Titanic Survival Prediction 🚢

This project predicts whether a Titanic passenger survived using a logistic regression model in Python.

## 🗂️ Project Files:
- `train.csv`: Training dataset
- `test.csv`: Dataset to make predictions
- `titanic_survival_prediction.py`: Main Python script
- `submission.csv`: Output predictions

## ⚙️ Libraries Used:
- pandas
- numpy
- scikit-learn

## 📌 How It Works:
1. Clean and preprocess data
2. Encode categorical variables
3. Train a logistic regression model
4. Predict survival for test data
5. Save results in `submission.csv`
